In Thy Kingdom remember us, O Lord, when Thou comest in Thy Kingdom.
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled.
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for your reward is great in heaven.
Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.
