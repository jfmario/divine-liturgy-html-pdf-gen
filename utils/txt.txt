O heavenly King, O Comforter, the Spirit of truth, who art in all places and fillest all things; Treasury of good things and Giver of life: Come and dwell in us and cleanse us from every stain, and save our souls, O gracious Lord. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, and good will among men. Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, and good will among men. O Lord, open Thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise. 
Blessed is the Kingdom of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: now and ever, and unto ages of ages.
